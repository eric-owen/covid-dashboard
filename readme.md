INTRODUCTION
------------
 
The Corona Dashboard displays a brief overview of Corona's impact on the United States. Consisting of data points for both country wide and intra state, the Dashboard provides total confirmed cases, recovered, and deceased, along with per state confirmed and deceased. To visually represent this data, a heat map is utilized pulling longitude and latitude of state counties with the points weighted by the number of confirmed cases for each county.
